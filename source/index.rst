This is the Phosphoros |version| main page, last updated |today|

Phosphoros is an implementation of a photometric redshift template fitting
method. For each model of a large set, computed from red-shifted and absorbed
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), is derived a probability from the
comparison of the computed to the observed photometric values. It can produce
Probability Density Function (PDF) in different dimensions, the most common and
useful one being the 1-D PDF providing probabilities as a function of redshift,
but it can also output the most likely photometric redshift.
