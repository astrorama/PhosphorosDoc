Introduction

Phosphoros is an implementation of a photometric redshift template fitting
method. For each model of a large set, computed from red-shifted and absorbed
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), is derived a probability from the
comparison of the computed to the observed photometric values. It can produce
Probability Density Function (PDF) in different dimensions, the most common and
useful one being the 1-D PDF providing probabilities as a function of redshift,
but it can also output the most likely photometric redshift.

The user manual is organized in a way to quickly use Phosphoros and next go deeper
and deeper of how to use Phosphoros.It finishes with a description of the file
formats manipulated by Phosphoros.
 
The user manual consists of the following sections:

- :ref:`Quickstart tutorial <quickstart>`: 15 minutes quickstart tutorial
- :ref:`First Steps <user-manual-first-steps>`: First steps with Phosphoros
- :ref:`Advanced Features <user-manual-advanced>`: Advanced features with Phosphoros
- :ref:`File Format Reference <format-reference-section>`: File format reference needed for Phosphoros
