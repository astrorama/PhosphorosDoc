Phosphoros is an implementation of a photometric redshift template fitting
method. For each model of a large set, computed from red-shifted and absorbed
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), is derived a probability from the
comparison of the computed to the observed photometric values. It can produce
Probability Density Function (PDF) in different dimensions, the most common and
useful one being the 1-D PDF providing probabilities as a function of redshift,
but it can also output the most likely photometric redshift.

software logic and explain the first steps of using it.

Phosphoros from the command line).

--ref--`gui`, which explains in detais the Phosphros |GUI| (how to use Phosphoros
from the graphical interface)
