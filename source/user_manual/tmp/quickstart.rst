Quickstart in 15 minutes
************************

If you have never used Phosphoros and you want to whet your appetite, this 15
minutes quickstart tutorial is intended just for you! It will give you a brief
overview of the Phosphoros workflow and guide you through a simple example of
computing photometric redshifts, without explaining in detail each step. At the
end of the quickstart you will have an idea how it feels like to use Phosphoros.

This quickstart assumes thet you have a functional version of Phosphoros already
installed. If you do not, before you continue, you should install Phosphoros by
following the instructions :ref:`here <phosphoros-install>`.

Getting the quickstart data
===========================

All the data required to run the quickstart are provided as a single tar.gz
file, which can be found in the :ref:`data` page. You just have to uncompress
the file in a directory called ``Phosphoros`` under your home directory. The
following commands will get the file and uncomress it::
    
    cd ~
    mkdir -p Phosphoros
    cd Phosphoros
    wget http://www.isdc.unige.ch/phosphoros/data/other/quickstart.tar.gz
    tar -xzf quickstart.tar.gz

Examining the input catalog
===========================

Go through the Quickstart catalog type definition (fast)

Examining the parameter space
=============================

Go through the Quickstart parameter space (fast)

Building the models
===================

Just demonstrate the generation (no other explenations)

Compute the redshifts
=====================

Run and create the output catalog in FITS and the PDFs

Visualizing the results
=======================

Only show the specz-phz plot
